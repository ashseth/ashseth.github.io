Perfect things suck. Imperfection is where it’s at.

Imperfect things are real. There is no absolute perfect anyway. It’s all a matter of perspective. You can’t please everybody. You can’t even please yourself if you’re always in pursuit of perfection.

Work hard to achieve great things in life. But always appreciate imperfect things. I’m talking about imperfect people, imperfect friendships, imperfect experiences, imperfect achievements, imperfect products and most importantly, the imperfect self. Because one day you might realize that the imperfection is perfect, in some way.

Constant pursuit of perfection till the day you die leaves you unhappy. What’s the point of that? You only get one shot at life.
